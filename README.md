Guided Media Python Curator - Currently a work in progress

If you're anything like me you have one huge media/downloads folder that gets 
bloated all the time with images/media/videos save from online content which
eventually needs to organized into folders. This process using manual drag and
drop interfaces can take forever - even subsorting can take hours. This program
is designed to make the process as quick as possible, organizing media into
sub-directories based on tags supplied by the user and online resources to 
modify existing file tags. The intention is to preform these actions without
having the user ever take their hands off the keyboard. Allowing users to use 
key commands to guide the curation process. Tags become folder directories and
create a tree based on given tags. After completing a curation process a tag 
library is produced so that the user can quickly begin a new sorting process
using already created tags.

The final idea being that you can move a file 'funnycat.jpg' in your downloads folder to somewhere that looks more like this:

/Pictures/Internet_Images/Cats/funnycat.jpg

Or organize your music so it looks more like this:

/Music/Artist/Album/Artist-SongName.mp3

Currently working on GUI development, more to come!
